# FireClassSizeML
Simple Neural Network model that predicts the class of a wildfire given some climate and location inputs. Originally was a regression model, but after trying multiple regression models (linear regression, kNN regression, Neural Network model), but did not get good results ~ 34% accuracy. Decided to change the project into a classification project instead, and got better results ~ 92% accuracy. Created GUI using Voila that will use default values if no inputs are provided. Future work includes balancing the dataset for better results, a more complicated NN model that can predict with higher accuracy, and interfacing with a weather API to minimize user input requirements.
